# nba_2017_scrape

This project consists of 2 parts:
  1. Gather and clean data using a python script from www.basketball-reference.com for the 2017-2018 NBA season. 
  2. Visualize the data in Tableau to compare teams' PPG, PAG, and scoring differentias to their win percentages.
  
The python scripts and resulting .csv file can be found in this repository.

The final visualization was posted to Tableau Public:
